# Data Cleaning Pipeline with Pandas

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Cleaning Pipeline repository. This project, led by João Henrique, aims to explore and implement efficient data cleaning techniques using Python's Pandas library. Our focus is on addressing common data challenges such as handling duplicates, outliers, and missing values.

## Project Overview

In this Jupyter notebook-based project, we:
- Simulate real-world data challenges with a sample DataFrame.
- Develop functions for data cleaning tasks:
  - `fill_missing_values` for managing missing data.
  - `drop_duplicates` for eliminating duplicate records.
  - `remove_outliers` for outlier detection and removal.
- Employ a streamlined pipeline approach for data cleaning.
- Perform visual and statistical analysis to compare pre and post-cleaning states.

Our goal is to provide a clear and effective methodology for data cleaning, applicable across various data analysis and data science contexts.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, the following Python libraries are required:
- pandas (version 2.0.3)
- numpy (version 1.24.3)
- matplotlib (version 3.7.1)
- seaborn (version 0.13.0)

Install these packages via pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
